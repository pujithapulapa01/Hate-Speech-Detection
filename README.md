# 🧠 Hate Speech Detection, Mitigation, and Beyond

Welcome to the official repository for the tutorial **"Hate Speech Detection, Mitigation and Beyond"**, presented at **ICWSM 2021** and **AAAI 2022**. This repository provides curated resources, demos, and datasets designed to empower researchers, developers, and social scientists in their work to understand, detect, and counter hate speech online.

## 📌 Abstract

Social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook have revolutionized communication by connecting billions of people. However, this transformation has come with significant societal challenges — including **online harassment, trolling, cyber-bullying, fake news, and hate speech**.

Among these, **hate speech** is uniquely harmful. It is deeply rooted in social and cultural structures and is often linked to real-world violence. While platforms rely on human moderators, the **sheer scale of online hate** has driven demand for **automated detection and mitigation systems**.

These systems pose technical and ethical challenges, making hate speech detection a critical focus area in **computational social science**.

## 🧮 Interactive Demos (Open in Colab)

We provide several hands-on Colab notebooks to let researchers and practitioners test models directly:

1. 🔤 **Multilingual Abuse Predictor**  
   Predict abusive content in multiple languages using language-specific transformer models.  
   👉 [Open in Colab](#)

2. 💬 **Rationale-Based Classifier**  
   Predict whether text is abusive and highlight the **rationale** behind the classification.  
   👉 [Open in Colab](#)

3. 🛡️ **Counter Speech Detection**  
   Identify content that attempts to counter hate speech in online discussions.  
   👉 [Open in Colab](#)

> ⚠️ **Note:** These models may exhibit **biases**. Use them cautiously and always review predictions in context.
